# Multi-Object Tracking with Deep Learning
This repository consists of scripts and frameworks used to develop, analyze and evaluate deep learning frameworks to describe objects. The work has tested out three different variations. 
1. With Masked Out Background (MOB) 
`scripts/tracking_ini.py` contains the script to run the tracker with evaluation. The tracker is implemented in ´utilities/tracker.py´
2. SuperPoint and SuperGlue. 
´scripts/tracking_superpoint` contains the script to run the tracker with evaluation. The tracker is implmented in ´utilities/tracker_superpoint.py´
3. MOB combined with SuperPoint and SuperGlue
